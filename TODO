%%
Need to pull out the binary search code in musicUtil/mkplaylist and put it here somewhere. Also, needs to be prototyped more like sort() and take a coderef for the comparison.


%%
cdburn

-I'd like it to do both data CDs and CD-DA with cdrdao. Based on the file extension? .iso or .toc

-Change this to use strict and also make the docs use the $opt_* vars.

-Need to add overburn support. Here are the switches:
    $ cdrecord driveropts=burnfree -sao -overburn dev=/dev/hdc foo.iso

-Maybe take out the default 24x and make it not specify at all? This would handle future faster drives without adjustment.


%%
hibernate

- This script's name conflicts with hibernate in the hibernate-script package. Not sure what to do about it yet, probably need better names for both suspend and hibernate.

- Also, may be a good idea to group suspend and hibernate into a subdir


%%
megawho

- Add info in usage: Please don't be a jerk with mega hits to whois services.


%%
router-reset

-Possibly add logging of when this is called.

%%
sshtun

- Write a document explaining:
   - what this is all for
   - the issues
   - things you need to do
   - things you need to install
   - and how to use the script.

- This project needs its own subdirectory


%%
general notes

-All apps should check for binary dependencies like cdlabelgen, vorbiscomment, etc

-Change all scripts to use here document for usage notes


%%
scripts going public

Candidates for this:
- megawho

Scripts slated for public release need some things:
- Author email address
- Version number
- Uniform and comprehensive help
- More idiot-proofing with args
- Licensing
