cdburn

-Change this to use strict and also make the docs use the $opt_* vars.

-Need to add overburn support. Here are the switches:
    $ cdrecord driveropts=burnfree -sao -overburn dev=/dev/hdc foo.iso

-Maybe take out the default 24x and make it not specify at all? This would handle future faster drives without adjustment.


%%
hibernate

- This script's name conflicts with hibernate in the hibernate-script package. Not sure what to do about it yet, probably need better names for both suspend and hibernate.

- Also, may be a good idea to group suspend and hibernate into a subdir


%%
hoursum

- This has been replaced by the Haskell timesheet project. Remove hoursum soon.


%%
megawho

- Add info in usage: Please don't be a jerk with mega hits to whois services.


%%
sshtun

   - what this is all for
   - the issues
   - things you need to do
   - things you need to install
   - and how to use the script.

- This project needs its own subdirectory


%%
general notes

-In a perfect world, all scripts would check for existence of binaries they call
