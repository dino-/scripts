cdburn

- Need to add overburn support. Here are the switches:
    $ cdrecord driveropts=burnfree -sao -overburn dev=/dev/hdc foo.iso

- Maybe take out the default 24x and make it not specify at all? This would handle future faster drives without adjustment.

%%
exifsetdate

- Document this thing so it's clear how to use it


%%
hibernate and suspend

- Change these to run pm-hibernate and pm-suspend. Anything else need to be done that pm-utils can't do?

- Also, may be a good idea to group suspend and hibernate into a subdir


%%
megawho

- Add info in usage: Please don't be a jerk with mega hits to whois services.


%%
sshtun

- Write a document explaining:
   - what this is all for
   - the issues
   - things you need to do
   - things you need to install
   - and how to use the script.

- This project needs its own subdirectory

- Try to make this a service that can start a boot time. Can be done without a controlling terminal?


%%
general notes

- In a perfect world, all scripts would check for existence of binaries they call

- Change all scripts to use here document for usage notes


%%
scripts going public

Candidates for this:
- megawho

Scripts slated for public release need some things:
- Author email address
- Version number
- Uniform and comprehensive help
- More idiot-proofing with args
- Licensing
