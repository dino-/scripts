# fix keyboard mapping using xkb

# Note: Don't bother using this if it can be achieved with custom xorg conf. See Dino's custom xkb project.

# This script exists primarily for me to occasionally hack in the
# ctrl:swap_rwin_rctl option for the Lenovo Legion Y740 laptop (which has no
# right Windows key (Super_R)).


# This is the external WASD mechanical keyboard
usbVendorId_WASDKeyboard="04d9:0169"

baseOptions='compose:prsc,ctrl:swapcaps'

xkbOptions=$(if lsusb | grep -q "$usbVendorId_WASDKeyboard"
  then echo "$baseOptions,keypad:pointerkeys"
  else echo "$baseOptions,ctrl:swap_rwin_rctl"
fi)

# These end up adding cumulatively, so we should clear them first
setxkbmap -option ''

setxkbmap -option "$xkbOptions"


# Additional notes, older stuff

# altwin:prtsc_rwin was good for ThinkPad X1 Carbons
# setxkbmap -option 'altwin:prtsc_rwin,compose:sclk,ctrl:swapcaps,keypad:pointerkeys'

# To view what things are set to:
# $ setxkbmap -print -verbose 10

# setxkbmap is the more civilized way to do these things but, if necessary,
# make an xkbcomp keymap file
# test -f ~/.Xkeymap && xkbcomp -w 3 ~/.Xkeymap $DISPLAY
