Need to pull out the binary search code in musicUtil/mkplaylist and put it here somewhere. Also, needs to be prototyped more like sort() and take a coderef for the comparison.

cdburn

-I'd like it to do both data CDs and CD-DA with cdrdao. Based on the file extension? .iso or .toc

-Change this to use strict and also make the docs use the $opt_* vars.

-Need to add overburn support. Here are the switches:
    $ cdrecord driveropts=burnfree -sao -overburn dev=/dev/hdc foo.iso

-Maybe take out the default 24x and make it not specify at all? This would handle future faster drives without adjustment.

megawho

- Add info in usage: Please don't be a jerk with mega hits to whois services.


--
router-reset

-Possibly add logging of when this is called.

sshtun

- Write a document explaining:
   - what this is all for
   - the issues
   - things you need to do
   - things you need to install
   - and how to use the script.

- This project needs its own subdirectory


--
xgo.hs

   - Decouple the data about what hardware to look for (identifiers) from the script. New file in /etc perhaps

   2007-07-08 rewrite

   What happens now:

   - locchk (actually was named locCheck) is supposed to be installed in /etc/init.d/. Runs at boot to detect our location.

      - Determines laptop location based on looking for the USB keyboard (or KVM)

      - Checks to see if it can find the mouse, which has been a known problem in the past.

      - Writes these things to a file: /var/tmp/locCheck

   - xgo script is used to call startx for us

      - Processes args

      - If suppress start-up was specified, export that as XGOSUPPRESS=1

         - This is for .xsession

      - Was a profile requested?

         - No: check the file from locchk, set the profile from that

         - Yes: Validate it's a known profile

      - Was no-action specified?

         - Yes: Show what would have been done.

         - No: exec startx with proper layout

   -----
   todo

   - Check for running X server, do not run again. How do we do this?

      $ pgrep X

      And check for 0 exit code (success)

   - Need to add the location searching stuff, but make it store results in the environment like suppress stuff.

   - Add default behavior of cd into user's home directory prior to starting X, with a switch to suppress this behavior as well.


   -----
   pass environment around like this:

      #! /usr/bin/env runhaskell

      module Main where

      import System.Posix.Env ( putEnv )
      import System.Process ( runCommand )


      main = do
         putEnv "FOO=1"
         runCommand "echo $FOO"

   New script will need to symlink the image in ~/artwork/desktop-art/

   Stuff for figuring out docked status, not used at this time:


   keyboards :: [String]
   keyboards =
      [ "Justcom Technology"  -- Raritan KVM switch
      , "CHESEN"              -- USB to PS/2 adapter
      ]
   keyboards2 =
      [ "CHESEN"
      , "Justcom Technology"
      ]
   keyboards3 =
      [ "CHESEN"
      , "fuck"
      ]


   searchKeyboard :: String -> Bool
   searchKeyboard devs = any match keyboards
      where
         match :: String -> Bool
         match keyboard =
            case (matchRegex (mkRegex keyboard) devs) of
                  Nothing -> False
                  _       -> True


--
general notes

-All apps should check for binary dependencies like cdlabelgen, vorbiscomment, etc

-Change all scripts to use here document for usage notes


--
scripts going public

Candidates for this:
- megawho

Scripts slated for public release need some things:
- Author email address
- Version number
- Uniform and comprehensive help
- More idiot-proofing with args
- Licensing
