# scripts

## Synopsis

Miscellaneous scripts (bash, Haskell, Perl)

## Description

This is a project for collecting those single-file scripts that we all end up writing over time. You want to use version control, but it's just one file. They stay in this project until they become big enough to have a project of their own.
